2025-06-07 15:32:33 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.abort_index_segment_size:50000	- Capacity (in number of txns) of an abort index segment. Each partition tracks the aborted transaction offset ranges to help service client requests.If the number transactions increase beyond this threshold, they are flushed to disk to easy memory pressure.Then they're loaded on demand. This configuration controls the maximum number of aborted transactions  before they are flushed to disk.
2025-06-07 15:32:33 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.abort_timed_out_transactions_interval_ms:10000	- Interval, in milliseconds, at which Redpanda looks for inactive transactions and aborts them.
2025-06-07 15:32:40 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.cloud_storage_recovery_topic_validation_mode:check_manifest_existence	- Validation performed before recovering a topic from object storage. In case of failure, the reason for the failure appears as `ERROR` lines in the Redpanda application log. For each topic, this reports errors for all partitions, but for each partition, only the first error is reported. This property accepts the following parameters: `no_check`: Skips the checks for topic recovery. `check_manifest_existence`:  Runs an existence check on each `partition_manifest`. Fails if there are connection issues to the object storage. `check_manifest_and_segment_metadata`: Downloads the manifest and runs a consistency check, comparing the metadata with the cloud storage objects. The process fails if metadata references any missing cloud storage objects.
2025-06-07 15:32:49 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.iceberg_rest_catalog_request_timeout_ms:10000	- Maximum length of time that Redpanda waits for a response from the REST catalog before aborting the request

2025-06-07 15:32:58 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.raft_heartbeat_disconnect_failures:3	- The number of failed heartbeats after which an unresponsive TCP connection is forcibly closed. To disable forced disconnection, set to 0.
2025-06-07 15:33:07 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.crash_loop_limit:{5}	- A limit on the number of consecutive times a broker can crash within one hour before its crash-tracking logic is reset. This limit prevents a broker from getting stuck in an infinite cycle of crashes. For more information see https://docs.redpanda.com/current/reference/properties/broker-properties/#crash_loop_limit.
2025-06-07 15:33:07 INFO [shard 0:main] main - application.cc:866 - redpanda.crash_loop_sleep_sec:{nullopt}	- The amount of time the broker sleeps before terminating the process when it reaches the number of consecutive times a broker can crash.
