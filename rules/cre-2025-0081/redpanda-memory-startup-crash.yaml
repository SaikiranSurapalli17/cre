      title: "Redpanda Crash Due to Memory Exhaustion and Startup Failures"
      category: "data-streaming"
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        Redpanda streaming platform crashes due to a combination of system-level failures including 
        permission denied errors for performance monitoring subsystems, missing critical configuration

        files, and memory allocation failures.
=======
        files, and memory allocation failures. This pattern indicates a misconfigured environment 
        leading to service unavailability.
>>>>>>> dca13c5 (Redpanda crash caused by memory exhaustion and startup failures)
      impact: |
        Complete streaming service outage affecting real-time data pipelines, potential message loss,
        cascading failures in downstream consumers, and degraded application performance. The crash
        with exit code 137 (SIGKILL) suggests forceful termination due to resource constraints.
      impactScore: 8
      cause: |
        Multi-factor failure combining insufficient kernel permissions (perf_event_paranoid settings),
        missing persistent configuration files (config_cache.yaml, .bootstrap.yaml), and container
        resource limits triggering OOMKiller. The memory_abort_on_alloc_failure setting causes
        immediate termination on memory exhaustion.
      mitigation: |
        1. Configure kernel parameters: echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
        2. Ensure proper volume mounts for /var/lib/redpanda/data and /etc/redpanda directories  
        3. Increase container memory limits and implement resource quotas
        4. Verify file system permissions and ownership (redpanda:redpanda)
        5. Implement readiness/liveness probes with appropriate restart policies
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
        6. Monitor memory usage and implement alerting on high utilization
        7. Consider disabling memory_abort_on_alloc_failure in development environments
